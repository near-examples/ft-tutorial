# Fungible Tokens Zero to Hero

In this _Zero to Hero_ series, you'll find a set of tutorials covering every aspect of a fungible token (FT) smart contract. You'll start by interacting with a pre-deployed contract and by the end you'll have built a fully-fledged FT smart contract that supports every extension of the standards.
