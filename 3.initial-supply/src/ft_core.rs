    // The `ft_transfer_call` process:

    // 1. Sender calls `ft_transfer_call` on FT contract
    // 2. FT contract transfers `amount` tokens from sender to receiver
    // 3. FT contract calls `ft_on_transfer` on receiver contract

    // N. FT contract resolves promise chain with `ft_resolve_transfer`, and may
    //    refund sender some or all of original `amount`
    //
    // Requirements:
    // * Contract MUST forbid calls to this function by any account except self
    // * If promise chain failed, contract MUST revert token transfer
    // * If promise chain resolves with a non-zero amount given as a string,
    //   contract MUST return this amount of tokens to `sender_id`
    //
    // Arguments:
    // * `sender_id`: the sender of `ft_transfer_call`
    // * `receiver_id`: the `receiver_id` argument given to `ft_transfer_call`
    // * `amount`: the `amount` argument given to `ft_transfer_call`
    //

    // integer of how many total tokens were spent by sender_id. Example: if sender
    // calls `ft_transfer_call({ "amount": "100" })`, but `receiver_id` only uses
    // 80, `ft_on_transfer` will resolve with `"20"`, and `ft_resolve_transfer`
    // will return `"80"`.
